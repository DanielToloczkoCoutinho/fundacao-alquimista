# **App Name**: Alchemist's Codex

## Core Features:

- Document Retrieval: Retrieve a specific document by section and key, such as an equation (EQ001) or a module (Module Ω), based on user input. Implement Trina Key validation for secured access.
- Link Preview & Summarization: Uses AI tool to preview links provided in the document and creates concise summaries to decide whether it's relevant.
- Key Generation Tool: Implement a utility to generate a Trina access key using SHA256 hashing based on the "ZENNITH-PHIARA-ANATHERON" string. This will serve as a tool for authentication when accessing certain documents.
- Section Navigation: Easy navigation through the main sections (Pensamento & Equações Vivas, Módulos & Ação, Infraestrutura Quântica, História Viva).
- Location Pinpointing: Render the geographical coordinates for key locations (e.g., Reactor Gaia) for easy reference, to support analysis and exploration.

- Primary color: Deep violet (#4C2A85) to represent alchemy, mysticism, and transformation.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E0FF) to create a soft, ethereal backdrop.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFC72C) to highlight key elements and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata', serif, for readability and literary feel.
- Use minimalistic icons that are geometric or alchemical symbols related to the sections and modules. (e.g. ouroboros, flower of life, etc.)
- A clean, modular layout with clear section divisions to enhance readability.
- Subtle transitions when navigating between sections.
