# **App Name**: Vortex Weave

## Core Features:

- Code Interpretation: Analyzes and interprets code to understand the logic and intent of complex algorithms from user input. Powered by LLMs, reasoning whether any action may need to be taken upon the supplied code.
- System Diagram Generation: Visually represents code as interactive diagrams to simplify complex system architecture. Convert uploaded .json or code snippets into diagram.
- Multidimensional Simulation: Generates interconnected scientific, biological, and quantum simulations
- Equation Display: Clearly displays generated equations.
- Data Logging: Log various data about the AI and UI including parameters of execution.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082), suggestive of both intellect and cosmic awareness. Note: This app involves material relating to alchemy.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a pale tint from the primary, and easy on the eyes, while remaining within the chosen hue range.
- Accent color: Soft orchid (#DA70D6), chosen for its proximity to the primary on the color wheel, but increased brightness for visibility and usability.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif with a modern, literary feel.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use sophisticated, minimalist icons that suggest energy flow, connectivity, and computation.
- Incorporate smooth, subtle transitions to enhance comprehension.
